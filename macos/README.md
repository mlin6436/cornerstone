The scripts will use home brew as the package manager for all the binaries and applications to be installed.

# Before Using the Script

There are no specific order of using `install-*` scripts, while it makes sense to start by installing all the binaries first.

In order to update all your binaries and applications, simply execute `update-*` script, or have it set up in your aliases to safe the trouble of typing.

# Note

Some popular applications still need to be installed manually:

- [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/)

Also, there are some applications better install according to the needs, manually:

- [XCode Command Line Tool](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) - in case you don't need complete XCode
- [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) - choose the version of Java you need
- [JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
- [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/platform) - this is available using brew cask, but better find the right cask you want
