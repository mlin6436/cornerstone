To save days and days on setting up a new Mac, and to ensure everyone has same setup up, use the automation scripts to streamline the work and make your life easier.

Note: you may need to change file permission to be able to execute them.

```bash
$ chmod 744 <setup>.sh
$ ./<setup>.sh
```

In addition, some great apps still need to be installed manually:

- [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/)
- [XBMC](http://kodi.tv/)
