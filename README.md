To save days and days on setting up a new Mac, and to ensure everyone has same setup up, use the automation scripts to streamline the work and make your life easier.

Note: you may need to change file permission to be able to execute them.

```bash
$ chmod 744 <setup>.sh
$ ./<setup>.sh
```

In addition, some great applicaitons still need to be installed manually:

- [Popcorn-Time](http://www.popcorn-time.se/)
- [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/)
- [XBMC](http://kodi.tv/)

Also, there are some applicaitons better install according to the needs, manually:

- [XCode Command Line Tool](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) - in case you don't need complete XCode
- [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) - choose the version of Java you need
- [JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
- [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/platform) - this is available using brew cask, but better find the right cask you want
