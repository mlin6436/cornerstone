To save days and days on setting up a new Mac, and to ensure everyone has same setup up, use the automation scripts to streamline the work and make your life easier.

Note: you may need to change file permission to be able to execute them.

```bash
$ chmod 744 <setup>.sh
$ ./<setup>.sh
```

In addition, some great apps still need to be installed manually:

```text
Popcorn-Time
Universal Translator
Wunderlist
XBMC
```
